2.	Both Linux and Windows are OK - Visual Studio or Eclipse.
3.	Use any source of information you like, but write the code yourself.
4.	Extra credit will be given for using ACE framework.
5.	For further questions please contact us.

Assignment Option 2: Prime numbers
Please write the fastest C++ program you can think of, that detects whether a number is prime or not. The numbers it must test are 64 bit long integers.
Use any dirty trick you can think of to get more juice out of your program and the host machine(s)!
Please provide an explanation of the reasoning behind your algorithm and implementation, and why you chose it.
Note: The algorithm here is not necessarily the most significant part. Consider multithreading!

Good Luck ÔÅä
